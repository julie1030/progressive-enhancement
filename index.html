<p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
    rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
    cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
    no such thing as an issue.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists
    if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses
    don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
    changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t
    see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
    reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
    on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s
    fake.
</p>

<p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
    person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls
    from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
    the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
    like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you
    passively do it anyway.

    </p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.<br>
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br>
        They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
        most unfortunate.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The farmer said, <strong>“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</strong><br>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that
        lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
    </p>
    <p>
        The farmer again said, <strong>“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't
            know.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
        while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer
        responded, <strong>“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</strong>
        </p>
    <p>
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
        people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg.
    </p>
    <p>
    Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!”
    Again, he said, <strong>“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</strong>
    </p>

    <cite>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of
        immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether
        anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never
        know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you
        never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</cite>

    <h2>Here is this dialog in the form of a table:</h2>
    <table>
        <caption align="bottom">Table representing the farmer's
            philosophy:</caption>
        <th>Event</th>
        <th>Good orBad?</th>
        <tr>
            <td>Lose a horse</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Win more horses</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Son injury</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Avoid war</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <u>Conclusion</u>
    <p>
         Good and Bad are just <strong>one perspective</strong>. Bananas are
        good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.
